                     <p>The new “Religious Studies Bibliography” RelBib is now online! Our comprehensive bibliographical database contains journal
                        articles of Religious Studies and related subjects. Apart from journals and articles, it is possible to search for monographs,
                        databases and other media genres relevant to the field of Religious Studies.</p>
                     <p>Further journals are gradually being integrated into our indexing procedure for articles. The alphabetical

                        list of journals</a> gives the latest information on which periodicals are being processed.</p>

                     <p>One particular feature of RelBib is the availability display: with that, you can quickly find out whether and where an article,
                        periodical or book is available. Links to online texts can be accessed directly if the publishers’ licenses allow it.</p>
                     <p>RelBib constitutes a free and open access service to the worldwide scholarly community of Religious Studies. The editor of RelBib is the
                        <a href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/nc/einrichtungen/universitaetsbibliothek/home.html" target="_blank">Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen</a>
                        (central library of the University of Tübingen). RelBib is being produced in close cooperation with

                        <p>You can choose between two different search modes in RelBib: “Simple Search” and “Advanced Search”.</p>
                        <div class="read-more-target">
                        <h3>Simple Search</h3>
                        <p>Enter a term in the search field and leave the search category on “All Fields”. The system will then search for this term in all
                           possible search fields. The drop-down menu allows you to narrow the search down to one specific category: title, author, call number (DDC),
                           subject or ISBN / ISSN.</p>

                        <p>You may specify your results by means of the filter settings in the right column of the search result list according to the
                           following criteria:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>time: year of publication</li>
                            <li>medium: open access, mediatype, format</li>
                            <li>classification: call number (DDC), RelBib classification</li>
                            <li>content: topic, genre, era, region</li>
                            <li>form: language, author, publisher</li>
                          </ul>
                        <p>Some of the filters allow multiple selection.</p>
                        <h3>Advanced Search</h3>
                        <p>You can start an “Advanced Search” if you click on the link underneath the search field. Compared to “Simple Search”, here it is possible to
                           start a search in several fields at the same time and thus to render your search more precisely. The "Match" setting lets you specify how
                           multiple search fields should be handled. For certain complex searches it might be more useful to operate with search groups.</p>
                        <p>In addition to that, in the advanced search mode you can narrow your search down <i>a priori</i> according to the following facets: RelBib classification;
                           format; language. Moreover, it is possible beforehand to set a publication period as well as the number of results listed per page.</p>

                    <p>Without a personal login you can see / use the following features in RelBib:                       Patron-Driven-Acquisition (PDA), availability check, RSS feed, citation, exporting and printing search results as well as the feedback button.<p>
                    <div class="read-more-target">
                    <h3>Patron-Driven-Acquisition (PDA)</h3>
                    <p>We are now offering a <a href="/relbib_docs/relbib-pda.pdf" target="_blank"> Patron Driven Acquisition (PDA)</a>
                       system which enables us to respond to special demands for Religious Studies’ literature in
                       Germany. When necessary, the required books are purchased by the University Library in Tübingen. At the RelBib website, users may directly
                       trigger the purchase of monographs which are not available at their current location and cannot be obtained through an inter-library loan.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h3>Availability checking</h3>
                    <p>A special highlight for users of RelBib is the checking of availablity of a title found during a search.</p>
                    <p>The link “HBZ Gateway” gets you to the checking of the availability of books in connection with your university.</p>
                    <p>The display "Journals Online & Print" (JOP) offers the same service for articles and periodicals. The JOP icons show you at one glance whether a periodical is available in your own university.</p>
                    <h3>Subito</h3>
                    <p>Instead of the inter-library loan you can order a title to be delivered directly to you via SUBITO, a service liable to costs. The link on your search
                       result display gets you to the website of this delivery service.</p>
                    <h3>Standing order by RSS feed</h3>
                    <p>You can book your search string which you would like to be repeated at certain intervals by RSS feed. Thus, you will get a notice whenever something
                       new has been added to RelBib. Please click on "Search Tools: Get RSS Feed" below the list of your search results to establish this service.</p>
                    <h3>Citation</h3>
                    <p>Under the link “Citation“  you can see your chosen title in three different citation styles (APA, MLA and Chicago). Please note that we are still working
                       on this: we plan to add more citation styles eventually.</p>
                    <h3>Exporting your search results</h3>
                    <p>You can export single search results as well as lists of search results into EndNote, BibTex and RIS.</p>
                    <h3>Printing your search results</h3>
                    <p>You can print the list of your search results directly from RelBib. For this you choose the titles you would like to have on the list, then click
                       “Print” above the research results. If necessary, you can adjust  the number of results per page.</p>
                    <h3>Feedback</h3>
                    <p>Finally, we would like to present a very important feature of RelBib to you: it is the "Feedback" button on the lower right corner.
                       You can send a feedback email from each point of your search, which then includes the URL of the present page. It is possible to
                       leave a comment describing the current problem. This will enable us to analyse it more easily.</p>

                       function by clicking on “Browse” in the area below the search field.</p>

                        <h3>Find Topic</h3>
                        <p>The <a href="<?=$this->url('keywordchainsearch-home')?>" target="_blank"><?=$this->transEsc('Browse Keywordchains')?></a> mode is intended to find subjects
                           and standardized subject groups that are similar to the terms entered. This is especially useful to obtain subject groups and titles
                           that are topically close to your originating search.
                           You can also switch to this mode from the other way around: Select a specific title which was catalogued with subject headings.
                           Just click on the <span class="iconlabel label label-info">B</span> button on the left of the subject heading string, and you will
                           see other titles which were catalogued with that string.</p>
                        <h3>Browse by Category</h3>
                        <p>The <a href="<?=$this->url('browse-home')?>" target="_blank"><?=$this->transEsc('Browse by Category')?></a> mode offers a way to start with some high
                           level categories and refine your search to certain aspects without the need to know specific search terms beforehand. Categories provided are
                           call number (DDC classmarks), RelBib classification, topic (subject heading), author and publisher. You are lead through a tree structure and may
                           filter the items you wish to browse by using other fields.</p>
                        <h3>Browse Alphabetically</h3>
                        <p>The  <a href="<?=$this->url('alphabrowse-home')?>" target="_blank"><?=$this->transEsc('Browse Alphabetically')?></a> mode offers a comprehensive
                           alphabetically sorted list of the contents of the respective categories. This is advantageous for survey research.
                           You can decide at which point in the alphabet you would like to step in and choose from the following aspects:
                           by topic, by author, by title or by call number.</p>
                        <p>This function is also useful when you are not sure how to spell the name of a given author or term: in that case just 
                           enter the first few letters of a word.</p>

                       You may then use the following functions:
                        <h3>Alerting function</h3>
                        <p>The alerting function lets you know when new articles from certain journals and new volumes from certain series are available. You may decide
                           in which cases you would like to get a corresponding message.</p>
                        <p>In order to receive alerts for a journal or a series, you first have to select the entry for the journal or series as a whole. You then click on the
                           “Bell” symbol <i class="fa fa-fw fa-bell"></i> which you will find on the right side of the corresponding entry. You can manage the list
                            of publications marked for an alert in your account under the heading “New Issue Alerting”.</p>
                        <h3>Saving search requests</h3>
                        <p>Your current search requests are temporarily stored in the search history. If you would like to have permanent access to certain search
                           requests, you can save them permanently in your account. You will find them under “Saved Searches” and may use them again through a simple
                           mouse click. This feature might be useful for complex requests or for subjects in which you have a continuing interest. In this way, you will
                           find the latest literature on a given subject or area of knowledge. Likewise, you can send your search request to another person via e-mail.</p>
                        <p>Select the corresponding search tool underneath the list of search results.</p>
                        <h3>Sending your search result list per e-mail</h3>
                        <p>You can also send your search result list or single entries to another person per e-mail. Choose individual entries or tick
                           “Select Page” above the list. Click the “E-Mail” button and enter the destination address.</p>
                        <p>Please notice: you can only send the entries of a single result page. The result set can be increased using the “Results per page” drop-down
                           menu above the list.</p>
                        <h3>Saving favorites</h3>
                        <p>You can save interesting titles directly in your account. Click on the “Star” symbol <i class="fa fa-fw fa-star"></i> in the result list
                           or in the detailed view. They are then permanently accessible, and you do not have to waste any time searching for them again.
                           You may keep your “favorites” in different lists  which you define yourself. In this way, you can assign interesting titles
                           to specific research projects or subjects. In your account, you can also export your favorites, send them per e-mail or print them.</p>
